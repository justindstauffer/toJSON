# To JSON

## These are scripts for taking "input.txt" files and separating by space and new line to create a JSON file. Effectively taking a list in text format and converting it to JSON for ease of use in other scripts.

The .txt file is accepted as input. The file is separated by new lines and each line is saved into an array. 

Then each index of the array is passed to the database and stored in a table. (Using Node and Express)

The data is able to be retreived as a JSON file through a get request to the same database table.
